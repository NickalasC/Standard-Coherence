              The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematics are organized by grade level in Grades
              Kâ€“8. At the high school level, the standards are organized by conceptual category (Number and Quantity,
              Algebra, Functions, Modeling, Geometry, and Statistics and Probability), showing the body of knowledge
              students should learn in each category to be college- and career-ready and to be prepared to study more
              advanced mathematics. An important consideration in implementation of the high school standards is how
              they might be organized into courses that provide a strong foundation for post-secondary success.
            </p>
            <p>
              High schools most often organize the standards through one of two pathways: Traditional - Algebra 1,
              Geometry, Algebra 2 or Integrated - Math 1, Math 2, Math 3.
